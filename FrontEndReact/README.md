# This is some information generated by a previous dev working on the rubric app
Before you can use React, you have to have Python3 and Node.js installed to use the npm installation
 
For windows users, I suggest using the Microsoft Store to install the current version of python3 (3.11 at time of writing)
Once installed, restart you machine

Node.js installation can be found at [https://nodejs.org/en] (version 18.16.0 at time of writing)
Follow the prompts for recommended users
Once it is installed, restart your machine (this is a must)

Every time you are in a new environment 'npm install' NEEDS to run PRIOR to npm start.
NOTE * npm install needs to be run in the terminal when the directory in \RUBRICAPP\FrontEndReact\ *
If you npm install in the \RUBCRICAPP\, it will cause issues

Once ' npm install ' is run, you can now use ' npm start ' to start the react application (suggestion: do after the datebase is run)
' npm start ' will start the React application at [http://localhost:3000]

## Database
Please refer to the readme file in the backend for further database instructions

--TLDR for front end Developers--
Go the terminal
type ' cd .\BackEndFlask\ '
ENTER
type ' python3 .\setupEnv.py'
ENTER

That should be everything required to begin frontend development

If the database seems to not have updated information:
type ' python3 .\setupEnv.py resetdb'

## Troubleshooting
check node version 'node -v'
check npm version 'npm -v'
restart computer (it sounds dumb but it has fixed more issues than you can imagine)


# The following details contain information on getting started running the React Server

    #-------------------------------------------------------------------------#
    | BEFORE RUNNING THE REACT SERVER, ENSURE THAT THE FLASK APP IS RUNNING!  |
    | LOOK AT THE README.md IN THE 'BackEndFlask' DIRECTORY FOR INSTRUCTIONS  |
    | ON GETTING THE FLASK APP RUNNING!                                       |
    #-------------------------------------------------------------------------#

    Ensure that Node.js is installed and up to date.
        - Visit [https://nodejs.org/en] for details on installing Node.js.
    Once installed, restart your machine.
    Ensure that npm is up to date.
    Open a new terminal window either in Visual Studio Code or on your local machine.
    Ensure that the current directory in the terminal window is 'FrontEndReact'.
    Note:
        If you DO NOT change the current directory to 'FrontEndReact' in the
        terminal window and continue, the React Server will NOT be setup correctly and
        therefore NOT run!!!
    Run 'npm install' to setup the dependencies.
    Run 'npm start' to start the development React Server.

    Notes About Troubleshooting: 
        If errors arise complaining about files contained in the 'node_modules'
        directory, stopping the development React Server, deleting the 'node_modules'
        directory, and rerunning 'npm install' tends to do the trick.
        If errors continue to arise, delete your local copy of the repository and
        reclone!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
