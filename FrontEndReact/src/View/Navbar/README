`BasicTabs.js`

Creates an instance of the BasicTabs component.

This component renders the top-level tab navigation used within instructor and admin dashboard views. It allows switching between:
 - Roster
 - Teams (conditionally shown depending on course settings)
 - Assessment Tasks
 - Reporting

The available tabs and the selected tab are synchronized with state tored in the parent `AppState` component.

Component behavior:
 - Computes which tab index should be active based on `activeTab`
 - Syncs internal tab state (`value`) by reacting to changes in `activeTab`
 - Renders Material UI `Tabs` and `Tab` components for navigation
 - Notifies the `AppState` parent when the user selects a new tab

Tab mapping:
 - "Users" → Roster
 - "Teams" → Teams (only when fixed teams are enabled)
 - "AssessmentTasks" → Assessment Task
 - "Reporting" → Reporting

This component does not manage application state directly, but instead delegates all navigation updates to the parent `AppState` component.

`Navbar.js`

Creates an instance of the ButtonAppBar component.

This component renders the main top navigation bar for the SkillBuilder application.
It provides:
 - Branding and application logo
 - Display of the currently logged-in user's name
 - An account dropdown menu with navigation and support options
 - A logout option via the <Logout> component

The component renders:
 - A top AppBar that remains consistent across pages
 - The SkillBuilder logo on the left
 - The user’s name and an expand/collapse button on the right
 - A Material UI dropdown menu with the following items:
    • My Account — switches to "UserAccount" tab
    • Support Center — opens external support link in new tab
    • Privacy Policy — switches to "PrivacyPolicy" tab
    • Logout — logs out via <Logout logout={props.logout} />

The component uses Material UI for layout and styling, and is intended as the primary navigation bar throughout the user-facing application.
