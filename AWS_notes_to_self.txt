Need to figure out how to get the ssh from the instance into Github.

Need to figure out how to continuesly update the github repo once into the repo.

Need to figure out whether if we need to install of the libraries from the requirments.text
one by one or if we can get away with installing the requirmeents.txt itself.

Need to figure out if the code will even run on the EC2 instance or not(though it doesn't seem like 
there should be much code change if any at all).
