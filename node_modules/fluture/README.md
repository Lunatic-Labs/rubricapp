Fluture offers a control structure similar to Promises, Tasks, Deferreds, and
what-have-you. Let's call them Futures.

Much like Promises, Futures represent the value arising from the success or
failure of an asynchronous operation (I/O). Though unlike Promises, Futures are
*lazy* and adhere to [the *monadic* interface](#interoperability).

Some of the features provided by Fluture include:

* [Cancellation](#cancellation).
* [Resource management utilities](#resource-management).
* [Stack safe composition and recursion](#stack-safety).
* [Integration](#sanctuary) with [Sanctuary][S].
* [A pleasant debugging experience](#debugging).

## Usage

> `npm install --save fluture`

On older environments you may need to polyfill one or more of the following
functions: [`Object.create`][JS:Object.create],
[`Object.assign`][JS:Object.assign] and [`Array.isArray`][JS:Array.isArray].

### EcmaScript Module

Fluture is written as modular JavaScript (`.mjs`). It can be loaded directly
by Node 9 and up using `--experimental-modules`, with the [esm loader][esm], or
with TypeScript (typings included).

Besides the module system, no other ES5+ features are used in Fluture's source,
which means that no transpilation is needed after concatenation.

```js
import {readFile} from 'fs';
import {node, encase} from 'fluture';

var getPackageName = file =>
  node(done => { readFile(file, 'utf8', done) })
  .chain(encase(JSON.parse))
  .map(x => x.name);

getPackageName('package.json')
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "fluture"
```

### CommonJS Module

Although the Fluture source uses the EcmaScript module system, versions
downloaded from the npm registry include a CommonJS build, which will
automatically be used when loading Fluture with `require`.

<!-- eslint-disable no-var -->
<!-- eslint-disable padding-line-between-statements -->
```js
var fs = require('fs');
var Future = require('fluture');

var getPackageName = function(file){
  return Future.node(function(done){ fs.readFile(file, 'utf8', done) })
  .chain(Future.encase(JSON.parse))
  .map(function(x){ return x.name });
};

getPackageName('package.json')
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "fluture"
```

### Global Bundle (CDN)

Fluture is hosted in full with all of its dependencies at
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/fluture-js/Fluture@11.0.3/dist/bundle.js

This script will add `Fluture` to the global scope.

## Interoperability

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpominov/static-land/master/logo/logo.png" align="right" height="82" alt="Static Land" />][6]

* `Future` implements [Fantasy Land][FL] and [Static Land][6] -compatible
  `Alt`, `Bifunctor`, `Monad`, and `ChainRec`
  (`of`, `ap`, `alt`, `map`, `bimap`, `chain`, `chainRec`).
  All versions of Fantasy Land are supported.
* `Future.Par` implements [Fantasy Land 3][FL] and [Static Land][6] -compatible
  `Alternative` (`of`, `zero`, `map`, `ap`, `alt`).
* The Future and ConcurrentFuture representatives contain `@@type` properties
  for [Sanctuary Type Identifiers][STI].
* The Future and ConcurrentFuture instances contain `@@show` properties for
  [Sanctuary Show][SS].

## Butterfly

The name "Fluture" is a conjunction of "FL" (the acronym to [Fantasy Land][FL])
and "future". Fluture means butterfly in Romanian: A creature one might expect
to see in Fantasy Land.

Credit goes to Erik Fuente for styling the logo, and [WEAREREASONABLEPEOPLE][9]
for sponsoring the project.

### Type signatures

The various function signatures are provided in a small language referred to as
Hindley-Milner notation. Read about [Hindley-Milner in JavaScript][Guide:HM]
here. On top of the basic Hindley-Milner notation, we use a few additions to
describe the JavaScript-specific stuff, like [methods](#squiggly-arrows)
or functions that take [multiple arguments at once](#brackets).

#### Squiggly Arrows

In order to document *methods*, we use the squiggly arrow (`~>`). This
separates the implicit `this` argument from the other, explicit, arguments.
For example, the following line signifies a method, as indicated by the
squiggly arrow:

```hs
Future.prototype.map :: Future a b ~> (b -> c) -> Future a c
```

For comparison, the following example shows a regular function:

```hs
map :: (b -> c) -> Future a b -> Future a c
```

#### Brackets

Most functions exposed by Fluture are curried. This is reflected in their type
signatures by using an arrow at each step where partial application is
possible. For example, the following line signifies a *curried* function,
because it has an arrow after each function argument:

```hs
add :: Number -> Number -> Number
```

We could have chosen to write the above line with "groups of one argument", but
we usually leave the grouping brackets out for brevity:

```hs
add :: (Number) -> (Number) -> Number
```

In order to document functions and methods that are *not* curried, we use
grouping to show which arguments have to be provided at the same time:

```hs
add :: (Number, Number) -> Number
```

#### Types

The concrete types you will encounter throughout this documentation:

- **Future** - Instances of Future provided by [compatible versions](#casting-futures) of Fluture.
- **ConcurrentFuture** - [Concurrified][concurrify] Futures ([`Future.Par`](#concurrentfuture)).
- **Promise** - Values which conform to the [Promises/A+ specification][7].
- **Nodeback a b** - A Node-style callback; A function of signature `(a | Nil, b) -> x`.
- **Pair a b** - An array with exactly two elements: `[a, b]`.
- **Iterator** - Objects with `next`-methods which conform to the [Iterator protocol][3].
- **Cancel** - The nullary [cancellation](#cancellation) functions returned from computations.
- **Catchable e f** - A function `f` which may throw an exception `e`.
- **List** - Fluture's internal linked-list structure: `{ head :: Any, tail :: List }`.
- **Context** - Fluture's internal debugging context object:
  `{ tag :: String, name :: String, stack :: String }`.

#### Type classes

Some signatures contain [constrained type variables][Guide:constraints].
Generally, these constraints express that some value must conform to a
[Fantasy Land][FL]-specified interface.

- **Functor** - [Fantasy Land Functor][FL:functor] conformant values.
- **Bifunctor** - [Fantasy Land Bifunctor][FL:bifunctor] conformant values.
- **Chain** - [Fantasy Land Chain][FL:chain] conformant values.
- **Apply** - [Fantasy Land Apply][FL:apply] conformant values.
- **Alt** - [Fantasy Land Alt][FL:alt] conformant values.

### Cancellation

Cancellation is a system whereby running Futures get an opportunity stop what
they're doing and release resources that they were holding, when the consumer
indicates it is no longer interested in the result.

To cancel a Future, it must be unsubscribed from. Most of the
[consumption functions](#consuming-futures) return an `unsubscribe` function.
Calling it signals that we are no longer interested in the result. After
calling `unsubscribe`, Fluture guarantees that our callbacks will not be
called; but more importantly: a cancellation signal is sent upstream.

The cancellation signal travels all the way back to the source (with the
exception of cached Futures - see [`cache`](#cache)), allowing all parties
along the way to clean up.

With the [`Future` constructor](#future), we can provide a custom cancellation
handler by returning it from the computation. Let's see what this looks like:

```js
// We use the Future constructor to create a Future instance.
var eventualAnswer = Future(function computeTheAnswer(rej, res){

  // We give the computer time to think about the answer, which is 42.
  var timeoutId = setTimeout(res, 60000, 42);

  // Here is how we handle cancellation. This signal is received when nobody
  // is interested in the answer any more.
  return function onCancel(){
    // Clearing the timeout releases the resources we were holding.
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
  };

});

// Now, let's fork our computation and wait for an answer. Forking gives us
// the unsubscribe function.
var unsubscribe = eventualAnswer.fork(console.error, console.log);

// After some time passes, we might not care about the answer any more.
// Calling unsubscribe will send a cancellation signal back to the source,
// and trigger the onCancel function.
unsubscribe();
```

Many natural sources in Fluture have cancellation handlers of their own.
[`after`](#after), for example, does exactly what we've done just now: calling
`clearTimeout`.

Finally, Fluture unsubscribes from Futures that it forks *for us*, when it no
longer needs the result. For example, both Futures passed into [race](#race)
are forked, but once one of them produces a result, the other is unsubscribed
from, triggering cancellation. This means that generally, unsubscription and
cancellation is fully managed for us behind the scenes.

### Stack safety

Fluture interprets our transformations in a stack safe way.
This means that none of the following operations result in a
`RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`:

```js
var add1 = x => x + 1;
var m = Future.of(1);

for(var i = 0; i < 100000; i++){
  m = m.map(add1);
}

m.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> 100001
```

```js
var m = (function recur(x){
  var mx = Future.of(x + 1);
  return x < 100000 ? mx.chain(recur) : mx;
}(1));

m.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> 100001
```

To learn more about memory and stack usage under different types of recursion,
see (or execute) [`scripts/test-mem`](scripts/test-mem).

### Debugging

First and foremost, Fluture type-checks all of its input and throws TypeErrors
when incorrect input is provided. The messages they carry are designed to
provide enough insight to figure out what went wrong.

Secondly, Fluture catches exceptions that are thrown asynchronously, and
exposes them to you in one of two ways:

1. By throwing an Error when it happens.
2. By calling your [exception handler](#forkcatch) with an Error.

The original exception isn't used because it might have been any value.
Instead, a regular JavaScript Error instance whose properties are based on the
original exception is created. Its properties are as follows:

- `name`: Always just `"Error"`.
- `message`: The original error message, or a message describing the value.
- `reason`: The original value that was caught by Fluture.
- `context`: A linked list of "context" objects. This is used to create the
  `stack` property, and you generally don't need to look at it. If debug mode
  is not enabled, the list is always empty.
- `stack`: The stack trace of the original exception if it had one, or the
  Error's own stack trace otherwise. If debug mode (see below) is enabled,
  additional stack traces from the steps leading up to the crash are included.
- `future`: The instance of [`Future`](#future) that was being
  [consumed](#consuming-futures) when the exception happened. Often printing it
  as a String can yield useful information. You can also try to consume it in
  isolation to better identify what's going wrong.

Finally, as mentioned, Fluture has a [debug mode](#debugmode) wherein
additional contextual information across multiple JavaScript ticks is
collected, included as an extended "async stack trace" on Errors, and
[exposed on Future instances](#context).

Debug mode can have a significant impact on performance, and uses up memory,
so I would advise against using it in production.

### Sanctuary

When using this module with [Sanctuary Def][$] (and [Sanctuary][S] by
extension) one might run into the following issue:

```js
var S = require('sanctuary');
var Future = require('fluture');
S.I(Future.of(1));
//! Since there is no type of which all the above values are members,
//! the type-variable constraint has been violated.
```

This happens because Sanctuary Def needs to know about the types created by
Fluture to determine whether the type-variables are consistent.

To let Sanctuary know about these types, we can obtain the type definitions
from [`fluture-sanctuary-types`][FST] and pass them to [`S.create`][S:create]:

```js
var {create, env} = require('sanctuary');
var {env: flutureEnv} = require('fluture-sanctuary-types');
var Future = require('fluture');

var S = create({checkTypes: true, env: env.concat(flutureEnv)});

S.I(Future.of(1));
//> Future.of(1)
```

### Casting Futures

Sometimes we may need to convert one Future to another, for example when the
Future was created by another package, or an incompatible version of Fluture.

When [`isFuture`](#isfuture) returns `false`, a conversion is necessary.
Usually the most concise way of doing this is as follows:

```js
var NoFuture = require('incompatible-future');
var incompatible = NoFuture.of('Hello');

//Cast the incompatible Future to our version of Future:
var compatible = Future(incompatible.fork.bind(incompatible));

compatible.both(Future.of('world')).value(console.log);
//> ["Hello", "world"]
```

### Creating Futures

#### Future

<details><summary><code>Future :: ((a -> Undefined, b -> Undefined) -> Cancel) -> Future a b</code></summary>

```hs
Future :: ((a -> Undefined, b -> Undefined) -> Cancel) -> Future a b
```

</details>

Creates a Future with the given computation. A computation is a function which
takes two callbacks. Both are continuations for the computation. The first is
`reject`, commonly abbreviated to `rej`; The second is `resolve`, or `res`.
When the computation is finished (possibly asynchronously) it may call the
appropriate continuation with a failure or success value.

Additionally, the computation may return a nullary function containing
cancellation logic. See [Cancellation](#cancellation).

```js
Future(function computation(reject, resolve){
  setTimeout(resolve, 3000, 'world');
});
```

#### of

<details><summary><code>of :: b -> Future a b</code></summary>

```hs
of             :: b -> Future a b
resolve        :: b -> Future a b
Future.of      :: b -> Future a b
Future.resolve :: b -> Future a b
```

</details>

Creates a Future which immediately resolves with the given value.

This function has an alias `resolve`.

```js
var eventualThing = Future.of('world');
eventualThing.fork(
  console.error,
  thing => console.log(`Hello ${thing}!`)
);
//> "Hello world!"
```

#### reject

<details><summary><code>reject :: a -> Future a b</code></summary>

```hs
reject        :: a -> Future a b
Future.reject :: a -> Future a b
```

</details>

Creates a Future which immediately rejects with the given value.

```js
var eventualFailure = Future.reject('I got so far!');
eventualFailure.fork(
  e => console.error('I tried so hard!', e),
  console.log
);
//! "I tried so hard! I got so far!"
```

#### after

<details><summary><code>after :: Number -> b -> Future a b</code></summary>

```hs
after :: Number -> b -> Future a b
```

</details>

Creates a Future which resolves with the given value after the given number of
milliseconds.

```js
var eventualThing = Future.after(500, 'world');
eventualThing.fork(console.error, thing => console.log(`Hello ${thing}!`));
//> "Hello world!"
```

#### rejectAfter

<details><summary><code>rejectAfter :: Number -> a -> Future a b</code></summary>

```hs
rejectAfter :: Number -> a -> Future a b
```

</details>

Creates a Future which rejects with the given reason after the given number of
milliseconds.

```js
var eventualError = Future.rejectAfter(500, new Error('Kaputt!'));
eventualError.fork(err => console.log('Oh no - ' + err.message), console.log);
//! Oh no - Kaputt!
```

#### do

<details><summary><code>do :: (() -> Iterator) -> Future a b</code></summary>

```hs
do :: (() -> Iterator) -> Future a b
go :: (() -> Iterator) -> Future a b
```

</details>

A way to do `async`/`await` with Futures, similar to Promise Coroutines or
Haskell Do-notation.

Takes a function which returns an [Iterator](#types), commonly a
generator-function, and chains every produced Future over the previous.

This function has an alias `go`, for environments where `do` is reserved.

```js
var eventualMessage = Future.do(function*(){
  var thing = yield Future.after(300, 'world');
  var message = yield Future.after(300, 'Hello ' + thing);
  return message + '!';
});

eventualMessage.fork(console.error, console.log);
//After 600ms:
//> "Hello world!"
```

To handle errors inside a `do` procedure, we need to [`fold`](#fold) the error
into our control domain, I recommend folding into an [`Either`][S:Either]:

```js
var attempt = Future.fold(S.Left, S.Right);
var ajaxGet = url => Future.reject('Failed to load ' + url);

var eventualMessage = Future.do(function*(){
  var e = yield attempt(ajaxGet('/message'));
  return S.either(
    e => `Oh no! ${e}`,
    x => `Yippee! ${x}`,
    e
  );
});

eventualMessage.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "Oh no! Failed to load /message"
```

#### try

<details><summary><code>try :: Catchable e (() -> r) -> Future e r</code></summary>

```hs
try     :: Catchable e (() -> r) -> Future e r
attempt :: Catchable e (() -> r) -> Future e r
```

</details>

Creates a Future which resolves with the result of calling the given function,
or rejects with the error thrown by the given function.

Short for [`Future.encase(f, undefined)`](#encase).

This function has an alias `attempt`, for environments where `try` is reserved.

```js
var data = {foo: 'bar'};
Future.try(() => data.foo.bar.baz)
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> [TypeError: Cannot read property 'baz' of undefined]
```

#### tryP

<details><summary><code>tryP :: (() -> Promise e r) -> Future e r</code></summary>

```hs
tryP :: (() -> Promise e r) -> Future e r
```

</details>

Create a Future which when forked spawns a Promise using the given function and
resolves with its resolution value, or rejects with its rejection reason.

Short for [`Future.encaseP(f, undefined)`](#encasep).

```js
Future.tryP(() => Promise.resolve('Hello'))
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "Hello"
```

#### node

<details><summary><code>node :: (Nodeback e r -> x) -> Future e r</code></summary>

```hs
node :: (Nodeback e r -> x) -> Future e r
```

</details>

Creates a Future which rejects with the first argument given to the function,
or resolves with the second if the first is not present.

Note that this function **does not support cancellation**.

Short for [`Future.encaseN(f, undefined)`](#encasen).

```js
Future.node(done => {
  done(null, 'Hello');
})
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "Hello"
```

#### encase

<details><summary><code>encase :: (Catchable e (a -> r)) -> a -> Future e r</code></summary>

```hs
encase  :: (Catchable e ((a      ) -> r)) -> a ->           Future e r
encase2 :: (Catchable e ((a, b   ) -> r)) -> a -> b ->      Future e r
encase3 :: (Catchable e ((a, b, c) -> r)) -> a -> b -> c -> Future e r
```

</details>

Takes a function and a value, and returns a Future which when forked calls the
function with the value and resolves with the result. If the function throws
an exception, it is caught and the Future will reject with the exception:

Partially applying `encase` with a function `f` allows us to create a "safe"
version of `f`. Instead of throwing exceptions, the encased version always
returns a Future when given the remaining argument(s):

Furthermore; `encase2` and `encase3` are binary and ternary versions of
`encase`, applying two or three arguments to the given function respectively.

```js
var data = '{"foo" = "bar"}';
var safeJsonParse = Future.encase(JSON.parse);
safeJsonParse(data).fork(console.error, console.log);
//! [SyntaxError: Unexpected token =]
```

#### encaseP

<details><summary><code>encaseP  :: ((a) -> Promise e r) -> a -> Future e r</code></summary>

```hs
encaseP  :: ((a) ->       Promise e r) -> a ->           Future e r
encaseP2 :: ((a, b) ->    Promise e r) -> a -> b ->      Future e r
encaseP3 :: ((a, b, c) -> Promise e r) -> a -> b -> c -> Future e r
```

</details>

Allows Promise-returning functions to be turned into Future-returning
functions.

Takes a function which returns a Promise, and a value, and returns a Future.
When forked, the Future calls the function with the value to produce the
Promise, and resolves with its resolution value, or rejects with its rejection
reason.

Furthermore; `encaseP2` and `encaseP3` are binary and ternary versions of
`encaseP`, applying two or three arguments to the given function respectively.

```js
var fetchf = Future.encaseP(fetch);

fetchf('https://api.github.com/users/Avaq')
.chain(res => Future.tryP(_ => res.json()))
.map(user => user.name)
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "Aldwin Vlasblom"
```

#### encaseN

<details><summary><code>encaseN  :: ((a, Nodeback e r) -> x) -> a -> Future e r</code></summary>

```hs
encaseN  :: ((a,       Nodeback e r) -> x) -> a ->           Future e r
encaseN2 :: ((a, b,    Nodeback e r) -> x) -> a -> b ->      Future e r
encaseN3 :: ((a, b, c, Nodeback e r) -> x) -> a -> b -> c -> Future e r
```

</details>

Allows [continuation-passing-style][1] functions to be turned into
Future-returning functions.

Takes a function which accepts as its last parameter a [Nodeback](#types), and
a value, and returns a Future. When forked, the Future calls the function with
the value and a Nodeback and resolves the second argument passed to the
Nodeback, or or rejects with the first argument.

Furthermore; `encaseN2` and `encaseN3` are binary and ternary versions of
`encaseN`, applying two or three arguments to the given function respectively.

```js
var fs = require('fs');

var read = Future.encaseN2(fs.readFile);

read('README.md', 'utf8')
.map(text => text.split('\n'))
.map(lines => lines[0])
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "# [![Fluture](logo.png)](#butterfly)"
```

#### chainRec

<details><summary><code>Future.chainRec :: ((a -> Next a, b -> Done b, a) -> Future e (Next a | Done b), a) -> Future e b</code></summary>

```hs
Future.chainRec :: ((a -> Next a, b -> Done b, a) -> Future e (Next a | Done b), a) -> Future e b
```

</details>

Implementation of [Fantasy Land ChainRec][FL:chainrec]. Since Fluture 6.0
introduced [stack safety](#stack-safety) there should be no need to use this
function directly. Instead it's recommended to use [`chain(rec)`](#chain).

### Transforming Futures

#### map

<details><summary><code>map :: Functor m => (a -> b) -> m a -> m b</code></summary>

```hs
map                  :: Functor m  => (a -> b) -> m a -> m        b
Future.map           :: Functor m  => (a -> b) -> m a -> m        b
Par.map              :: Functor m  => (a -> b) -> m a -> m        b
Future.prototype.map :: Future e a ~> (a -> b)        -> Future e b
```

</details>

Transforms the resolution value inside the Future, and returns a Future with
the new value. The transformation is only applied to the resolution branch: if
the Future is rejected, the transformation is ignored.

See also [`chain`](#chain) and [`mapRej`](#maprej).

```js
Future.of(1)
.map(x => x + 1)
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> 2
```

For comparison, an approximation with Promises is:

```js
Promise.resolve(1)
.then(x => x + 1)
.then(console.log, console.error);
```

#### bimap

<details><summary><code>bimap :: Bifunctor m => (a -> c) -> (b -> d) -> m a b -> m c d</code></summary>

```hs
bimap                  :: Bifunctor m => (a -> c) -> (b -> d) -> m a b -> m      c d
Future.bimap           :: Bifunctor m => (a -> c) -> (b -> d) -> m a b -> m      c d
Future.prototype.bimap :: Future a b  ~> (a -> c,     b -> d)          -> Future c d
```

</details>

Maps the left function over the rejection value, or the right function over the
resolution value, depending on which is present.

```js
Future.of(1)
.bimap(x => x + '!', x => x + 1)
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> 2

Future.reject('error')
.bimap(x => x + '!', x => x + 1)
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//! "error!"
```

For comparison, an approximation with Promises is:

```js
Promise.resolve(1)
.then(x => x + 1, x => Promise.reject(x + '!'))
.then(console.log, console.error);
//> 2

Promise.reject('error')
.then(x => x + 1, x => Promise.reject(x + '!'))
.then(console.log, console.error);
//! "error!"
```

#### chain

<details><summary><code>chain :: Chain m => (a -> m b) -> m a -> m b</code></summary>

```hs
chain                  :: Chain m    => (a -> m        b) -> m a -> m        b
Future.chain           :: Chain m    => (a -> m        b) -> m a -> m        b
Future.prototype.chain :: Future e a ~> (a -> Future e b) ->        Future e b
```

</details>

Sequence a new Future using the resolution value from another. Similarly to
[`map`](#map), `chain` expects a function to transform the resolution value of
a Future. But instead of returning the new *value*, chain expects a Future to
be returned.

The transformation is only applied to the resolution branch: if the Future is
rejected, the transformation is ignored.

See also [`chainRej`](#chainrej).

```js
Future.of(1)
.chain(x => Future.of(x + 1))
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> 2
```

For comparison, an approximation with Promises is:

```js
Promise.resolve(1)
.then(x => Promise.resolve(x + 1))
.then(console.log, console.error);
//> 2
```

#### swap

<details><summary><code>swap :: Future a b -> Future b a</code></summary>

```hs
swap                  :: Future a b -> Future b a
Future.prototype.swap :: Future a b ~> Future b a
```

</details>

Resolve with the rejection reason, or reject with the resolution value.

```js
Future.of(new Error('It broke')).swap().fork(console.error, console.log);
//! [It broke]

Future.reject('Nothing broke').swap().fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "Nothing broke"
```

#### mapRej

<details><summary><code>mapRej :: (a -> c) -> Future a b -> Future c b</code></summary>

```hs
mapRej                  ::               (a -> c) -> Future a b -> Future c b
Future.prototype.mapRej :: Future a b ~> (a -> c)               -> Future c b
```

</details>

Map over the **rejection** reason of the Future. This is like [`map`](#map),
but for the rejection branch.

```js
Future.reject(new Error('It broke!'))
.mapRej(err => new Error('Oh No! ' + err.message))
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//! [Oh No! It broke!]
```

For comparison, an approximation with Promises is:

```js
Promise.reject(new Error('It broke!'))
.then(null, err => Promise.reject(new Error('Oh No! ' + err.message)))
.then(console.log, console.error);
//! [Oh No! It broke!]
```

#### chainRej

<details><summary><code>chainRej :: (a -> Future c b) -> Future a b -> Future c b</code></summary>

```hs
chainRej                  ::               (a -> Future c b) -> Future a b -> Future c b
Future.prototype.chainRej :: Future a b ~> (a -> Future c b)               -> Future c b
```

</details>

Chain over the **rejection** reason of the Future. This is like
[`chain`](#chain), but for the rejection branch.

```js
Future.reject(new Error('It broke!'))
.chainRej(err => Future.of(err.message + ' But it\'s all good.'))
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "It broke! But it's all good."
```

For comparison, an approximation with Promises is:

```js
Promise.reject(new Error('It broke!'))
.then(null, err => err.message + ' But it\'s all good.')
.then(console.log, console.error);
```

#### fold

<details><summary><code>fold :: (a -> c) -> (b -> c) -> Future a b -> Future d c</code></summary>

```hs
fold                  ::               (a -> c) -> (b -> c) -> Future a b -> Future d c
Future.prototype.fold :: Future a b ~> (a -> c,     b -> c)               -> Future d c
```

</details>

Applies the left function to the rejection value, or the right function to the
resolution value, depending on which is present, and resolves with the result.

This provides a convenient means to ensure a Future is always resolved. It can
be used with other type constructors, like [`S.Either`][S:Either], to maintain
a representation of failure.

```js
Future.of('hello')
.fold(S.Left, S.Right)
.value(console.log);
//> Right('hello')

Future.reject('it broke')
.fold(S.Left, S.Right)
.value(console.log);
//> Left('it broke')
```

For comparison, an approximation with Promises is:

```js
Promise.resolve('hello')
.then(S.Right, S.Left)
.then(console.log);
//> Right('hello')

Promise.reject('it broke')
.then(S.Right, S.Left)
.then(console.log);
//> Left('it broke')
```

### Combining Futures

#### ap

<details><summary><code>ap :: Apply m => m (a -> b) -> m a -> m b</code></summary>

```hs
ap                  :: Apply m => m        (a -> b) -> m        a -> m        b
Future.ap           :: Apply m => m        (a -> b) -> m        a -> m        b
Par.ap              :: Apply m => m        (a -> b) -> m        a -> m        b
Future.prototype.ap ::            Future e (a -> b) ~> Future e a -> Future e b
```

</details>

Applies the function contained in the left-hand Future to the value
contained in the right-hand Future. If one of the Futures rejects the
resulting Future will also be rejected.

```js
Future.of(x => y => x + y)
.ap(Future.of(1))
.ap(Future.of(2))
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> 3
```

#### and

<details><summary><code>and :: Future a b -> Future a c -> Future a c</code></summary>

```hs
and                  :: Future a b -> Future a c -> Future a c
Future.prototype.and :: Future a b ~> Future a c -> Future a c
```

</details>

Logical *and* for Futures.

Returns a new Future which either rejects with the first rejection reason, or
resolves with the last resolution value once and if both Futures resolve. We
can use it if we want a computation to run only after another has succeeded.

See also [`alt`](#alt) and [`finally`](#finally).

```js
Future.after(300, null)
.and(Future.of('hello'))
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "hello"
```

With good old `reduce`, we can turn this into an asynchronous `all` function,
where the resulting Future will be the leftmost to reject, or the rightmost to
resolve.

```js
var all = ms => ms.reduce(Future.and, Future.of(0));
all([Future.after(20, 1), Future.of(2)]).value(console.log);
//> 2
```

#### alt

<details><summary><code>alt :: Alt f => f a -> f a -> f a</code></summary>

```hs
alt                  :: Alt f => f a -> f a -> f a
or                   :: Alt f => f a -> f a -> f a
Future.alt           :: Alt f => f a -> f a -> f a
Par.alt              :: Alt f => f a -> f a -> f a
Future.prototype.alt :: Future a b ~> Future a b -> Future a b
Future.prototype.or  :: Future a b ~> Future a b -> Future a b
```

</details>

Select one of two [Alts](#types).

Behaves like logical *or* on [`Future`](#future) instances, returning a new
Future which either resolves with the first resolution value, or rejects with
the last rejection reason. We can use it if we want a computation to run only
if another has failed.

Behaves like [`race`](#race) on [`ConcurrentFuture`](#concurrentfuture) instances.

This function has an alias `or` for legacy reasons.

See also [`and`](#and) and [`finally`](#finally).

```js
Future.rejectAfter(300, new Error('Failed'))
.alt(Future.of('hello'))
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "hello"
```

With good old `reduce`, we can turn this into an asynchronous `any` function,
where the resulting Future will be the leftmost to resolve, or the rightmost
to reject.

```js
var any = ms => ms.reduce(Future.alt, Future.reject('empty list'));
any([Future.reject(1), Future.after(20, 2), Future.of(3)]).value(console.log);
//> 2
```

#### finally

<details><summary><code>finally :: Future a c -> Future a b -> Future a b</code></summary>

```hs
finally                  ::               Future a c -> Future a b -> Future a b
lastly                   ::               Future a c -> Future a b -> Future a b
Future.prototype.finally :: Future a b ~> Future a c               -> Future a b
Future.prototype.lastly  :: Future a b ~> Future a c               -> Future a b
```

</details>

Run a second Future after the first settles (successfully or unsuccessfully).
Rejects with the rejection reason from the first or second Future, or resolves
with the resolution value from the first Future. We can use this when we want
a computation to run after another settles, successfully or unsuccessfully.

If you're looking to clean up resources after running a computation which
acquires them, you should use [`hook`](#hook), which has many more fail-safes
in place.

This function has an alias `lastly`, for environments where `finally` is
reserved.

See also [`and`](#and) and [`alt`](#alt).

```js
Future.of('Hello')
.finally(Future.of('All done!').map(console.log))
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "All done!"
//> "Hello"
```

Note that the *first* Future is given as the *last* argument to `Future.finally()`:

```js
var program = S.pipe([
  Future.of,
  Future.finally(Future.of('All done!').map(console.log)),
  Future.fork(console.error, console.log)
]);

program('Hello');
//> "All done!"
//> "Hello"
```

### Consuming Futures

#### fork

<details><summary><code>fork :: (a -> Any) -> (b -> Any) -> Future a b -> Cancel</code></summary>

```hs
fork                  ::               (a -> Any) -> (b -> Any) -> Future a b -> Cancel
Future.prototype.fork :: Future a b ~> (a -> Any,     b -> Any)               -> Cancel
```

</details>

Execute the computation represented by a Future, passing `reject` and `resolve`
callbacks to continue once there is a result.

This function is called `fork` because it literally represents a fork in our
program: a point where a single code-path splits in two. It is recommended to
keep the number of calls to `fork` at a minimum for this reason. The more
forks, the higher the code complexity.

Generally, one only needs to call `fork` in a single place in the entire
program.

After we `fork` a Future, the computation will start running. If the program
decides halfway through that it's no longer interested in the result of the
computation, it can call the `unsubscribe` function returned by `fork()`. See
[Cancellation](#cancellation).

Note that if an exception was encountered during the computation, it will be
thrown and likely not be catchable. If the computation ran in isolation, we may
want to use [`forkCatch`](#forkcatch) instead to recover from exceptions.

```js
Future.of('world').fork(
  err => console.log(`Oh no! ${err.message}`),
  thing => console.log(`Hello ${thing}!`)
);
//> "Hello world!"

Future.reject(new Error('It broke!')).fork(
  err => console.log(`Oh no! ${err.message}`),
  thing => console.log(`Hello ${thing}!`)
);
//! "Oh no! It broke!"

var consoleFork = Future.fork(console.error, console.log);
consoleFork(Future.of('Hello'));
//> "Hello"
```

#### forkCatch

<details><summary><code>forkCatch :: (Error -> Any) -> (a -> Any) -> (b -> Any) -> Future a b -> Cancel</code></summary>

```hs
forkCatch                  ::               (Error -> Any) -> (a -> Any) -> (b -> Any) -> Future a b -> Cancel
Future.prototype.forkCatch :: Future a b ~> (Error -> Any,     a -> Any,     b -> Any)               -> Cancel
```

</details>

An advanced version of [fork](#fork) that allows us to react to a fatal error
in a custom way. Fatal errors occur when unexpected exceptions are thrown, when
the Fluture API is used incorrectly, or when resources couldn't be disposed.

The exception handler will always be called with an instance of `Error`,
independent of what caused the crash.

**Using this function is a trade-off;**

Generally it's best to let a program crash and restart when an a fatal error
occurs. Restarting is the surest way to restore the memory that was allocated
by the program to an expected state.

By using `forkCatch`, we can keep our program alive after a fatal error, which
can be very beneficial when the program is being used by multiple clients.
However, since fatal errors might indicate that something, somewhere has
entered an invalid state, it's probably still best to restart our program upon
encountering one.

See [Debugging](#debugging) for information about the Error object that is
passed to your exception handler.

```js
var fut = Future.after(300, null).map(x => x.foo);
fut.forkCatch(e => {
  console.error('fatal error:', e.stack);
  console.error('caused in: ', e.future.toString());
  process.exit(1);
}, console.error, console.log);
//! fatal error: Cannot read property 'foo' of null
//!   at ...
//! caused in: Future.after(300, null).map(x => x.foo)
```

#### value

<details><summary><code>value :: (b -> x) -> Future a b -> Cancel</code></summary>

```hs
value                  ::               (b -> x) -> Future a b -> Cancel
Future.prototype.value :: Future a b ~> (b -> x)               -> Cancel
```

</details>

Extracts the value from a resolved Future by forking it. Only use this function
if you are sure the Future is going to be resolved, for example; after using
[`fold`](#fold). If the Future rejects and `value` was used, an uncatchable
`Error` will be thrown.

```js
Future.reject(new Error('It broke'))
.fold(S.Left, S.Right)
.value(console.log);
//> Left([Error: It broke])
```

As with [`fork`](#fork), `value` returns an `unsubscribe` function. See
[Cancellation](#cancellation).

#### done

<details><summary><code>done :: Nodeback a b -> Future a b -> Cancel</code></summary>

```hs
done                  ::               Nodeback a b -> Future a b -> Cancel
Future.prototype.done :: Future a b ~> Nodeback a b               -> Cancel
```

</details>

Fork the Future into a [Nodeback](#types).

This is like [`fork`](#fork), but instead of taking two unary functions, it
takes a single binary function.

As with [`fork`](#fork), `done` returns an `unsubscribe` function. See
[Cancellation](#cancellation).

```js
Future.of('hello').done((err, val) => console.log(val));
//> "hello"
```

#### promise

<details><summary><code>promise :: Future a b -> Promise b a</code></summary>

```hs
promise                  :: Future a b -> Promise b a
Future.prototype.promise :: Future a b ~> Promise b a
```

</details>

An alternative way to [`fork`](#fork) the Future. Returns a Promise which
resolves with the resolution value, or rejects with the rejection reason of
the Future.

Note that if an exception was encountered during the computation, it will be
thrown and likely not be catchable.

```js
Future.of('Hello').promise().then(console.log);
//> "Hello"
```

This is a convenience function which provides a "quick and dirty" way to create
a Promise from a Future. You should only use it in scenarios where you're not
interested in [cancellation](#cancellation), nor interested in recovering from
exceptions. For example in a test runner that wants you to give it a Promise.
In any other scenario, if you *really* want a Promise, you should probably
make a custom wrapper around [`forkCatch`](#forkcatch) to create your Promise,
for example:

```js
const eventualThing = Future.after(300, 'World');

new Promise((res, rej) => {

  // We've decided that an exception should go to the rejection branch, and
  // we're wrapping the failure or success values to not lose information.
  const cancel = eventualThing.forkCatch(rej, reason => {
    res({success: false, reason: reason, value: null});
  }, value => {
    res({success: true, reason: null, value: value});
  });

  // We're also handling cancellation here.
  process.on('SIGINT', cancel);

});
```

### Parallelism

#### race

<details><summary><code>race :: Future a b -> Future a b -> Future a b</code></summary>

```hs
race                  :: Future a b -> Future a b -> Future a b
Future.prototype.race :: Future a b ~> Future a b -> Future a b
```

</details>

Race two Futures against each other. Creates a new Future which resolves or
rejects with the resolution or rejection value of the first Future to settle.

When one Future settles, the other gets cancelled automatically.

```js
Future.after(100, 'hello')
.race(Future.after(50, 'bye'))
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "bye"
```

With good old `reduce`, we can turn this into a `first` function, where the
resulting Future will be the first to resolve, or the first to reject.

```js
var first = futures => futures.reduce(Future.race, Future.never);
first([
  Future.after(100, 'hello'),
  Future.after(50, 'bye'),
  Future.rejectAfter(25, 'nope')
])
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//! "nope"
```

#### both

<details><summary><code>both :: Future a b -> Future a c -> Future a (Pair b c)</code></summary>

```hs
both                  :: Future a b -> Future a c -> Future a (Pair b c)
Future.prototype.both :: Future a b ~> Future a c -> Future a (Pair b c)
```

</details>

Run two Futures in parallel and get a [`Pair`](#types) of the results. When
either Future rejects, the other Future will be cancelled and the resulting
Future will reject.

```js
var a = Future.of('a');
var b = Future.of('b');

Future.both(a, b).fork(console.error, console.log);
//> ['a', 'b']
```

#### parallel

<details><summary><code>parallel :: PositiveInteger -> Array (Future a b) -> Future a (Array b)</code></summary>

```hs
parallel :: PositiveInteger -> Array (Future a b) -> Future a (Array b)
```

</details>

Creates a Future which when forked runs all Futures in the given Array in
parallel, ensuring no more than `limit` Futures are running at once.

When one Future rejects, all currently running Futures will be cancelled and
the resulting Future will reject.

```js
var tenFutures = Array.from(Array(10).keys()).map(Future.after(20));

//Runs all Futures in sequence:
Future.parallel(1, tenFutures).fork(console.error, console.log);
//after about 200ms:
//> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

//Runs upto five Futures in parallel:
Future.parallel(5, tenFutures).fork(console.error, console.log);
//after about 40ms:
//> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

//Runs all Futures in parallel:
Future.parallel(Infinity, tenFutures).fork(console.error, console.log);
//after about 20ms:
//> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

If you want to settle all Futures, even if some may fail, you can use this in
combination with [fold](#fold):

```js
var unstableFutures = Array.from({length: 4}, (_, i) =>
  Future.node(done => done(Math.random() > 0.75 ? 'failed' : null, i))
);

var stabalizedFutures = unstableFutures.map(Future.fold(S.Left, S.Right));

Future.parallel(Infinity, stabalizedFutures).fork(console.error, console.log);
//> [ Right(0), Left("failed"), Right(2), Right(3) ]
```

#### ConcurrentFuture

The `ConcurrentFuture` type is the result of applying
[`concurrify`][concurrify] to `Future`. It provides a mechanism for
constructing a [Fantasy Land `Alternative`][FL:alternative] from a member of
`Future`. This allows Futures to benefit from the Alternative Interface, which
includes parallel `ap`, `zero` and `alt`.

The idea is that we can switch back and forth between `Future` and
`ConcurrentFuture`, using [`Par`](#par) and [`seq`](#seq), to get sequential or
concurrent behaviour respectively. It's a useful type to pass to abstractions
that don't know about Future-specific functions like [`parallel`](#parallel) or
[`race`](#race), but *do* know how to operate on Apply and Alternative.

```js
var {of, ap, sequence} = require('sanctuary');
var {Future, Par, seq} = require('fluture');

//Some dummy values
var x = 1;
var f = a => a + 1;

//The following two are equal ways to construct a ConcurrentFuture
var parx = of(Par, x);
var parf = Par(of(Future, f));

//We can make use of parallel apply
seq(ap(parx, parf)).value(console.log);
//> 2

//Or concurrent sequencing
seq(sequence(Par, [parx, parf])).value(console.log);
//> [x, f]
```

##### Par

Converts a Future to a ConcurrentFuture.

<details><summary><code>Par :: Future a b -> ConcurrentFuture a b</code></summary>

```hs
Par :: Future a b -> ConcurrentFuture a b
```

</details>

##### Par.of

Constructs a ConcurrentFuture with the given resolution value.

<details><summary><code>Par.of :: b -> ConcurrentFuture a b</code></summary>

```hs
Par.of :: b -> ConcurrentFuture a b
```

</details>

##### Par.zero

Constructs a ConcurrentFuture which will never resolve or reject with anything.

<details><summary><code>Par.zero :: () -> ConcurrentFuture a a</code></summary>

```hs
Par.zero :: () -> ConcurrentFuture a a
```

</details>

##### seq

Converts a ConcurrentFuture to a Future.

<details><summary><code>seq :: ConcurrentFuture a b -> Future a b</code></summary>

```hs
seq :: ConcurrentFuture a b -> Future a b
```

</details>

### Resource management

Functions listed under this category allow for more fine-grained control over
the flow of acquired values.

#### hook

<details><summary><code>hook :: Future a b -> (b -> Future c d) -> (b -> Future a e) -> Future a e</code></summary>

```hs
hook :: Future a b -> (b -> Future c d) -> (b -> Future a e) -> Future a e
```

</details>

Combines resource acquisition, consumption, and disposal in such a way that you
can be sure that a resource will always be disposed if it was acquired, even if
an exception is thrown during consumption; Sometimes referred to as bracketing.

The signature is like `hook(acquire, dispose, consume)`, where:

- `acquire` is a Future which might create connections, open files, etc.
- `dispose` is a function that takes the result from `acquire` and should be
  used to clean up (close connections etc). The Future it returns must
  resolve, and its resolution value is ignored. If it rejects, a fatal error
  is raised which can only be handled with [`forkCatch`](#forkcatch).
- `consume` is another Function takes the result from `acquire`, and may be
  used to perform any arbitrary computations using the resource.

Typically, you'd want to partially apply this function with the first two
arguments (acquisition and disposal), as shown in the example.

<!-- eslint-disable no-undef -->
```js
var withConnection = Future.hook(
  openConnection('localhost'),
  closeConnection
);

withConnection(conn => query(conn, 'SELECT * FROM users'))
.fork(console.error, console.log);
```

When a hooked Future is cancelled while acquiring its resource, nothing else
will happen. When it's cancelled after acquistion completes, however, the
disposal will still run, and if it fails, an exception will be thrown.

If you have multiple resources that you'd like to consume all at once, you can
use [Fluture Hooks](https://github.com/fluture-js/fluture-hooks) to combine
multiple hooks into one.

### Utility functions

#### pipe

<details><summary><code>pipe :: Future a b ~> (Future a b -> c) -> c</code></summary>

```hs
Future.prototype.pipe :: Future a b ~> (Future a b -> c) -> c
```

</details>

A method available on all Futures to allow arbitrary functions over Futures to
be included in a fluent-style method chain.

This method is particularly useful in combination with functions derived from
Fantasy Land implementations, for example [`S.join`][S:join]:

```js
Future.of(42)
.map(Future.resolve)
.pipe(S.join)
.value(console.log);
//> 42
```

#### cache

<details><summary><code>cache :: Future a b -> Future a b</code></summary>

```hs
cache :: Future a b -> Future a b
```

</details>

Returns a Future which caches the resolution value or rejection reason of the
given Future so that whenever it's forked, it can load the value from cache
rather than re-executing the underlying computation.

This essentially turns a unicast Future into a multicast Future, allowing
multiple consumers to subscribe to the same result. The underlying computation
is never [cancelled](#cancellation) unless *all* consumers unsubscribe before
it completes.

There is a glaring drawback to using `cache`, which is that returned Futures
are no longer referentially transparent, making reasoning about them more
difficult and refactoring code that uses them harder.

```js
var {readFile} = require('fs');
var eventualPackage = Future.cache(
  Future.node(done => {
    console.log('Reading some big data');
    readFile('package.json', 'utf8', done);
  })
);

eventualPackage.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "Reading some big data"
//> "{...}"

eventualPackage.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "{...}"
```

#### isFuture

<details><summary><code>isFuture :: a -> Boolean</code></summary>

```hs
isFuture :: a -> Boolean
```

</details>

Returns true for [Futures](#types) and false for everything else. This function
(and [`S.is`][S:is]) also return `true` for instances of Future that were
created within other contexts. It is therefore recommended to use this over
`instanceof`, unless your intent is to explicitly check for Futures created
using the exact `Future` constructor you're testing against.

<!-- eslint-disable no-unused-expressions -->
```js
var Future1 = require('/path/to/fluture');
var Future2 = require('/other/path/to/fluture');
var noop = () => {};

var m1 = Future1(noop);
Future1.isFuture(m1) === (m1 instanceof Future1);
//> true

var m2 = Future2(noop);
Future1.isFuture(m2) === (m2 instanceof Future1);
//> false
```

#### never

<details><summary><code>never :: Future a a</code></summary>

```hs
never :: Future a a
```

</details>

A Future that never settles. Can be useful as an initial value when reducing
with [`race`](#race), for example.

#### isNever

<details><summary><code>isNever :: a -> Boolean</code></summary>

```hs
isNever :: a -> Boolean
```

</details>

Returns `true` if the given input is a `never`.

#### extractLeft

<details><summary><code>extractLeft :: Future a b -> Array a</code></summary>

```hs
extractLeft                  :: Future a b       -> Array a
Future.prototype.extractLeft :: Future a b ~> () -> Array a
```

</details>

Returns an array whose only element is the rejection reason of the Future.
In many cases it will be impossible to extract this value; In those cases, the
array will be empty. This function is meant to be used for type introspection:
it is **not** the correct way to [consume a Future](#consuming-futures).

#### extractRight

<details><summary><code>extractRight :: Future a b -> Array b</code></summary>

```hs
extractRight                  :: Future a b       -> Array b
Future.prototype.extractRight :: Future a b ~> () -> Array b
```

</details>

Returns an array whose only element is the resolution value of the Future.
In many cases it will be impossible to extract this value; In those cases, the
array will be empty. This function is meant to be used for type introspection:
it is **not** the correct way to [consume a Future](#consuming-futures).

#### debugMode

<details><summary><code>debugMode :: Boolean -> Undefined</code></summary>

```hs
debugMode :: Boolean -> Undefined
```

</details>

Enable or disable Fluture's debug mode. Debug mode is disabled by default.
Pass `true` to enable, or `false` to disable.

```js
Future.debugMode(true);
```

For more information, see [Debugging](#debugging) and [Context](#context).

#### context

```hs
context :: Future a b ~> List Context
```

A linked list of debugging contexts made available on every instance of
`Future`. When [debug mode](#debugmode) is disabled, the list is always empty.

The context objects have `stack` properties which contain snapshots of the
stacktraces leading up to the creation of the `Future` instance. They are used
by Fluture to generate asynchronous stack traces.

```js
Future.debugMode(true);
const future = Future.after(10, 'Hello');

let context = future.context;
while(context.head){
  console.log(context.head.stack);
  context = context.tail;
}
```
