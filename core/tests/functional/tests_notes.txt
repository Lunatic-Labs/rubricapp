This file essentially deals with some documentation regarding the functional tests.

At the top of each tests, there is a header that essentially explains what route the functional test(s) are testing. Some of them will
have a "TO BE UPDATED" line in them. This basically is stating that the route has only been tested for one particular route without considering
the parameters that are in. Basically, this means the route was hardcoded. Hopefully, there will be time to figure out how to get each individual
project tested, but that may be for another time.
