--------------------------------------------
What to work on next:
--------------------------------------------
- feedback_time needs to be the difference between when a completed assessment assessment_task
  is created and when the completed_assessment_task is next viewed
  - Dr. Hammond discussed calling the route from the completed_assessment_time and grabbing the server time then
- feedback routes needs to be merged into ratings routes so that all the ratings and the feedback lag time
  can be displayed on the same view
- the same kind of route needs to be created with teams
    - probably the same kind of join/format can be created
