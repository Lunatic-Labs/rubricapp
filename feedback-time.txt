What to work on next:
--------------------------------------------
- feedback_time needs to be the difference between when a completed assessment assessment_task
  is created and when the completed_assessment_task is next viewed
  - Dr. Hammond discussed calling the route from the completed_assessment_time and grabbing the server time then
- feedback routes needs to be merged into ratings routes so that all the ratings and the feedback lag time
  can be displayed on the same view
- the same kind of route needs to be created with teams
    - probably the same kind of join/format can be created

What to work on next:

- How to do comparison operators with the join?

Scratch work:
- I'll need to grab the completed_assessment_task's finished time
  and subtract it from the feedback_time. Can I grab the completed_assessment_task's end
  time from completed_assessment_id along with feedback_time and then create a new attribute 
  in the feedback table called 'lag_time' and subtract the two? If so, how do I do this?
    - If not, do I need to join tables?

Yesterday: Pretty much worked on getting the routes and joins working
           Data shows, not the correct data though
           Feedback and Ratings routes are merged

Today: Still doing this (hopefully close)
