Gunicorn:
    What is Gunicorn?
        Gunicorn 'Green Unicorn' is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX. It's a pre-fork worker model. The Gunicorn 
        server is broadly compatible with various web frameworks, simply implemented, light on server resources, and fairly speedy.

    How does it work with nginx?
        Nginx is set up as reverse proxy server to a Gunicorn server running on localhost port 8000. 
        Gunicorn translates requests which it gets from Nginx into a format which your web application can handle, 
        and makes sure that your code is executed when needed.
    
    Does Gunicorn work with Flask?
        Yes
    
    Is Gunicorn open source?
        Apparently Yes
    
    Why use it?
        Honestly IDK, it doesn't make much sense why we need to use it with nginx.
        All I know that multiple differnt sites say that we need use Gunicorn with 
        nginx while other sites say that it isn't needed.
    

    When using a reverse proxy, or many Python hosting 
    platforms, the proxy will intercept and forward all external requests to the local WSGI server.
