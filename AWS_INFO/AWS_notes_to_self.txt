Figure out the connection between gunicorn and nginx
    sub task of this :
    figure out whether if gunicorn is needed (I guess it is needed, but still)
        It is needed
    If Gunicorn is needed, then figure out the config stuff (it is quite weird and confusing)
        Working on this with Brian

Figure out how to set up nginx

Figure out how to tell the Flask application that it is behind a proxy

Figure out how to change the development server to a production server

Figure out if Nginx is even needed or if I should just go to Apache - (Just go with Nginx)

Get Brian on the EC2 Instance to get two brains on the task

Once Nginx, Gunicorn, and the flask application are all working together, then get everyone on the EC2 Instance

Make sure to that I have a usb drive to get everyone the private key.
