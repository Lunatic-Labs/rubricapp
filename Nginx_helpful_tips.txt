Below is an example on how to create and configure a server in nginx:
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}

Below is how to run the live app through nginx:
$ sudo npm install pm2 -g
$ pm2 start bin/www (path to your node project's main file)
$ pm2 save
$ sudo pm2 startup
$ sudo service nginx restart
(should take a few minutes to run the application)
