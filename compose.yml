    ports: [] # Disable exposed port so that Redis can run inside of the container and not be exposed to host machine -> If using [] for the redis stuff, keeping right beside "ports: " works because apparently implicit map keys need to be followed by map values (the implicit map key thing is the error I got if I tried to do a similar thing to the port binding comment below (I don't know why, but I think it's due to it being an empty list and thus needs to be right beside the ":"))
