SkillBuilder (previously known as RubricApp) is a web application for evaluating students' professional skills, such as teamwork and communication.

SkillBuilder is implemented in two parts:  the front end is a React application, and the back end is a python Flask application.  There are separate README files in each folder that explain how to install and run each part of the application.
