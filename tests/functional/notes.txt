Things to discuss:

The link above should provide information on dealing with databases.

From this, figure out how I would be able to set up a temporary database
given the way the database is initialized/created in the current app.py file.

Overall, the main question/goal of this is to figure out how to be logged in
while testing applications so that different routes' views can be tested. 

Also, ask how the groups are going to be split up after testing/modularization/refactoring.

Currently, we're trying to figure out the whole app.test_client
situation and see how it affects my conftest.py.

Continue to look into this.
